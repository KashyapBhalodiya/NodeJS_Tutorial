    <!---------------- Combinators --------------------------->
    <!-- Basic Selectors:
    
    Universal selectors: *
    Type selectors: Like tag. Ex: p, li, a
    Class selectors: .class_name
    ID selectors: #id_name
    Attribute selectors: Syntax: [attr] - Represents elements with an attribute name of attr.
    [attr=value], [attr=value], [attr|=value], [attr^=value], [attr$=value],
    [attr*=value], [attr operator value i]
    -->

    <!-- Grouping selectors: (,)
    The , selector is a grouping method that selects all the matching nodes.
    Ex: div, span
    -->

    <!-- Combinators:
    Descendant combinator:
    The (space) combinator selects nodes that are descendants of the first element.
    Ex: div span
    
    Child combinator:
    The > combinator selects nodes that are direct children of the first element.
    Ex: ul > li
    
    General sibling combinator:
    The ~ combinator selects siblings. This means that the second element follows 
    the first and both share the same parent.
    Ex: p ~ span

    Adjacent sibling combinator:
    The + combinator matches the second element only if it immediately follows the first element.
    Ex: h2 + p

    Column combinator:
    The || combinator selects nodes which belong to a column.
    Ex: col || td

    <!-- Psuedo:
    Psuedo classes:
    The : pseudo allow the selection of elements based on state information 
    that is not contained in the document tree. 

    Psuedo elements:
    The :: pseudo represent entities that are not included in HTML.
